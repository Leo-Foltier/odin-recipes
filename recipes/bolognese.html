    <h2>A Meaty Bolognese Sauce Made for Busy Weeknights.</h2>
    <h3>We love day of long, slow cooking as much as the next person, but (sadly) every day cannot be Sunday. Classic Bolognese sauce recipes call for lengthy simmer times—we’ve read recipes that call for up to six hours of cooking—but our Bolognese recipe is all about speed. This easy Bolognese sauce comes together in just 30 minutes, because we’ve got to get dinner on the table on Tuesday nights, too. This is a stick-to-your-ribs sauce—hearty and filling, it’s a one-bowl supper that everyone will love.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup grated carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup celery, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup celery, minced</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20)</li>
        <li>lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1 25 oz jar store-bought marinara</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 lb wide pasta noodles, such as pappardelle or tagliatelle</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in carrots along with celery and onions and sauté until they're just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the ground beef and ground pork, and cook until browned, breaking up the meat as you stir.</li>
        <li>Pour in the jar of store-bought marinara sauce along with salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>When the Bolognese sauce has reached your desired consistency, stir in the heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and serve over your favorite pasta—we like to use pappardelle or tagliatelle—and top with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Enjoy!</li>
