    <h3>Toss golden garlic and silky olive oil through spaghetti to make this classic Italian dish – ready in the time it takes to boil the pasta. It's simple, flavourful and perfect for busy days.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3-4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 small red chilli, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>a small handful parsley, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of well-salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti for about 10 mins, or until al dente – it should retain a little bite.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is nearly ready, heat the oil in a frying pan set over a medium heat and sizzle the garlic and chilli, if using, for 1 minute until fragrant and the garlic is lightly golden but not brown (the garlic will taste bitter if it gets too dark).</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti and add it to the garlicky oil with the parsley. Season and toss to combine, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
